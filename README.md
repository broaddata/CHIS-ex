# CHIS-ex
CHIS Exercise for Springboard
The file CHIS.R contains all of the code for the tutorial exercises covered in the ggplot2 course as part of Exploratory Data Analysis.
Since the instructions did not specifiy which exercise to put in the R code file, I copied and pasted all of the code from all of the exercises.
Each exercise is separated with a commented line beginning with a # followed by dashes. The beginning and ending of the exercises are noted at the top and bottom of the script.
If only one exercise was required (Maybe the last?) it is included in this file.
